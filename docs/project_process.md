1. Backend Infrastructure & Skeleton

(you are currently here)

Focus:

Environment

Tooling

Process

“Can this system exist?”

Ends when:

Backend runs

GraphQL endpoint exists

No real domain logic yet

⬅️ FIRST BIG BREAKING POINT

2. Domain & API Shape (Schema-first)

Focus:

What exists in the system

How data is structured

How frontend will talk to backend

Ends when:

GraphQL schema is stable

Queries return meaningful domain data

Still no UI

⬅️ SECOND BIG BREAKING POINT

3. AI Integration as a System Actor

Focus:

Prompt design

Constraints

Ethics & framing

Dynamic vs persistent outputs

Ends when:

AI-generated interpretations are available via API

No UI polish yet

⬅️ THIRD BIG BREAKING POINT

4. Frontend Foundation (Structure, not beauty)

Focus:

Data fetching

Page skeleton

Layout and spacing

Single page wired end-to-end

Ends when:

One page renders real data

Looks unfinished but coherent

⬅️ FOURTH BIG BREAKING POINT

5. Curtain Mode (Differentiator)

Focus:

Dual-layer experience

Engineering notes surfaced

Intentional affordances

Ends when:

Curtain can be toggled

It reveals something meaningful

It doesn’t break the art experience

⬅️ FIFTH BIG BREAKING POINT

6. Visual Refinement & Taste

Focus:

Typography

Spacing

Motion

Mood

Ends when:

Page feels “finished”

No new features added

⬅️ FINAL STOP
