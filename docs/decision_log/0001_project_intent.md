# Decision 0001: Project intent and scope

## Context
The project originated from the desire to showcase an artist’s work publicly while also serving as a professional portfolio piece for a software engineer. There was a risk of the project becoming either a purely technical demo or an overengineered art site.

## Decision
The project will be art-first and technology-second. The primary user experience is a public-facing art gallery. A secondary, intentionally hidden “behind the curtain” layer will expose technical decisions and development process for technically minded visitors.

## Alternatives considered
- A traditional developer portfolio website, which would prioritise technical presentation over the artwork.
- A purely static art gallery site, which would not meaningfully showcase engineering capability.

## Consequences
This decision prioritises aesthetic quality and restraint in the main experience, while allowing technical depth to exist without dominating. It constrains overt technical UI elements and requires discipline in how engineering detail is surfaced.
